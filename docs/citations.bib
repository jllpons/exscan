            In the era of ubiquitous high‐throughput sequencing studies, there is a growing need for analysis tools that are not just performant but also comprehensive and user‐friendly enough to cater to both novice and advanced users. This article introduces SeqKit2, the next iteration of the widely used sequence analysis tool SeqKit, featuring expanded functionality, performance optimizations, and support for additional compression methods. Retaining a pragmatic subcommand architecture, SeqKit2 represents substantial enhancement through the inclusion of 19 additional subcommands, expanding its overall repertoire to a total of 38 in eight categories. The new subcommands add functionality such as amplicon processing and robust, error‐tolerant parsing of sequence records. In addition, three subcommands designed for real‐time analysis are added for periodic monitoring of properties of FASTQ and Binary Alignment/Map alignment records and real‐time streaming from multiple sequence files. The performance of SeqKit2 is benchmarked against the old version of SeqKit, Bioawk, Seqtk, and SeqFu tools. SeqKit2 consistently outperforms its predecessor, albeit with marginally higher memory usage, while maintaining competitive runtimes against other tools. With its broad functionality, proven usability, and ongoing development driven by user feedback, we hope that bioinformaticians will find SeqKit2 useful as a “Swiss army knife” of sequence and alignment processing—equally adept at facilitating ad hoc analyses and seamlessly integrating into larger pipelines.

            Summary: The Biopython project is a mature open source international collaboration of volunteer developers, providing Python libraries for a wide range of bioinformatics problems. Biopython includes modules for reading and writing different sequence file formats and multiple sequence alignments, dealing with 3D macro molecular structures, interacting with common tools such as BLAST, ClustalW and EMBOSS, accessing key online databases, as well as providing numerical methods for statistical learning.
            Availability: Biopython is freely available, with documentation and source code at www.biopython.org under the Biopython license.

            Motivation: Testing for correlations between different sets of genomic features is a fundamental task in genomics research. However, searching for overlaps between features with existing web-based methods is complicated by the massive datasets that are routinely produced with current sequencing technologies. Fast and flexible tools are therefore required to ask complex questions of these data in an efficient manner.
            Results: This article introduces a new software suite for the comparison, manipulation and annotation of genomic features in Browser Extensible Data (BED) and General Feature Format (GFF) format. BEDTools also supports the comparison of sequence alignments in BAM format to both BED and GFF features. The tools are extremely efficient and allow the user to compare large datasets (e.g. next-generation sequencing data) with both public and custom genome annotation tracks. BEDTools can be combined with one another as well as with standard UNIX commands, thus facilitating routine genomics tasks as well as pipelines that can quickly answer intricate questions of large genomic datasets.
            Availability and implementation: BEDTools was written in C++. Source code and a comprehensive user manual are freely available at http://code.google.com/p/bedtools
